As a transparent company, we also share our issues. On December 5th at 10:30 PM UTC we had a network outage in our data center in Iceland. We noticed this promptly with our monitoring systems and quick help from [Daniel](https://twitter.com/DanielLockyer) (our server hero). After 10 minutes our servers were reachable again and the outage was over.

It's the second time the whole data center was disconnected. We don't want this to happen again, so we are planning to move away from this provider. You can follow [the progress here](https://github.com/simpleanalytics/roadmap/issues/180).

Anyhow, we keep on working hard on being the best privacy friendly analytics tool out there. Sorry again and thank you for your support which keeps us motivated to work on something as cool as Simple Analytics.
