Some customers had issues with our custom domain feature. In your graph you could see some data changes (up or down) because of that issue. We had too many users using that feature (it's popular) and it were to many for our server at that time. We fixed this issue as of 3th of March by moving that server away from Iceland to The Netherlands.

We are very happy we already where moving most of our server to a more robust datacenter in The Netherlands. We keep on working hard on being the best privacy friendly analytics tool out there. Sorry and thank you for your support which keeps us motivated to  work on something as cool as Simple Analytics.
