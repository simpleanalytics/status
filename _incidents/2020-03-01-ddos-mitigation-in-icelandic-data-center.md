On March 1st at 12:05 PM UTC we had a network outage in our data center in Iceland. Our hosting provider suffered an attack, and have moved to DDOS mitigation. That's why some of the requests didn't succeed anymore.

We redirected our new public scripts to a new server in The Netherlands. That traffic is routing fine. The external server that supports the custom domain feature is unfortunately still located in Iceland. We will move this last server to The Netherlands this week.

We are very happy we already where moving most of our server to a more robust datacenter in The Netherlands. We keep on working hard on being the best privacy friendly analytics tool out there. Sorry and thank you for your support which keeps us motivated to  work on something as cool as Simple Analytics.
