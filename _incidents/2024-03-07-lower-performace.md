We did have some issues with a huge amount of data coming in. A huge customer send us data every second for many users. We have systems in place to easily block traffic from one domain. The issue was resolved on <time datetime="{{ '2024-03-07T18:56:00Z' | date_to_xmlschema }}">{{ '2024-03-07T18:56:00Z' | date: "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S" }} UTC</time>.

We are checking if any data has been missed for other customers.
