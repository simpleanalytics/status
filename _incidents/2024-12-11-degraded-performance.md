There is some degraded performance on incoming data. Not all data points seem to be stored. We are investigating this issue now. 

Update 02:24 UTC: we found the issue and solved it. Around 22% of the incoming visits didn't get stored in the last 2 hours. We are keeping an extra eye out in the next few hours.
