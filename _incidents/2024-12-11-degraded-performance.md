We identified that one of our systems caused certain requests to run extremely slowly, resulting in a large number of timeouts. Weâ€™ve implemented a hot fix, and since then, 100% of incoming data has been processed and stored successfully.

In total, about 38% of requests failed over a 9.5-hour period due to this performance issue.

We will continue to monitor the system and work on a long-term solution.
