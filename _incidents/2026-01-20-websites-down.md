Our dashboard and public websites are mostly down. We are investigating the issue. Data is still coming in.

Update: our hosting provider performed scheduled maintenance to replace a public switch. The maintenance window started at 20-01-2026 08:00 CET with an expected downtime of 30 minutes. We did not miss any visits. All systems are running normally again.

Update: something is not working correctly. We are investigating.
